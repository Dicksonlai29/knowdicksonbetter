            <p>Hi! Meet the 18 years-old boy from a small town in Malaysia -- Dickson! Originated from Penang, Malaysia,
                the home to many delicacies and cuisines, I was awarded ASEAN Scholarship to study in Singapore since 2022.

                        <p>Exco Position: Secretary</p>
                        <p>Being part of the Modern Dance Club has been a rewarding experience for me. 
                            I was exposed to various dance genres, such as contemporary, jazz and hip hop, 
                            and learned to appreciate the diversity and beauty of movement. Dancing was 
                            also an avenue for me to relieve my stress and express myself creatively. I 
                            enjoyed the time spent with my fellow dancers, who were supportive and inspiring. 
                            We worked hard together to showcase our skills and passion in our bi-annual
                            conert, 'REVERIE' and thanks to that, I gained the opportunity to perform several times 
                            in front of my cohort during school events. The time spent learning new dances, laughing,
                            chilling in dance studio is definitely an indelible memory for me that will live rent-free
                            forever in my head. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am able to hone my leadership skills through carry out the duty 
                            of a Secretary
                            in the club. I learnt important organising skills and coordinating skills when
                            planning out activity schedule, and releasing announcement to members to ensure 
                            clarity in the message delivered. If I were to sum up my feelings for it,
                            it would say I am forever grateful for the chance to be part of this amazing club.

                        <p>Ask me one thing that I remembered the most from my JC life, it would be 
                            the memories that I made with my fellow "Cheerios". We laugh, we support each other
                            while we devoted ample time and effort to train with dilligence. Being a part 
                            of the team has allowed me to not only hone my dance skills 
                            but also develop essential life skills. I have learned to collaborate
                            efficiently with my team members, tackle unforeseen challenges calmly,
                            and adapt to various situations promptly. Through my participation
                            in the Cheerleading Team, I have experienced personal growth as 
                            both a dancer and an individual. I look forward to continuing
                            my journey of learning and self-improvement through my passion for dance.</p>

                        <h3>Defy Camp 2023: 躍飛 - Facilitator</h3>
                        <p>Lead. Defy our limit. Rise to the ocassion. These
                            are the three key takeaways for me from this camp.
                            It's truly a wholesome series of programme where I
                            step up as a group facilitator for the first time. It 
                            was a great opportunity to learn how to lead a group of 
                            campers, make quick decisions in response to unexpected 
                            events and keep them entertained with fun activities. 
                            I realised how strong one's resilience, both physical and
                            mental, can be if we are determined to do something as we 
                            all successfully walked 25km in one night to raise 
                            funds and food supplies for needy families in the community,
                            something that we never imagined to be attainable before. 
                            It is this challenge that taught me to be braver and more 
                            confident in facing difficulties in life. 
                            Defy Camp was a rewarding and 
                            enriching experience that I will never forget.

                        <p>
                            During Orientation 2023,
                            I had the opportunity to forge new friendships with other 
                            facilitators and the incoming juniors. I also enjoyed giving a 
                            warm welcome and support to the new students who were joining our 
                            campus. I wanted them to feel comfortable and excited about their 
                            academic journey. I also tried to hype up the school spirit by 
                            leading cheers, games and activities that showcased our values and 
                            culture. I see orientation as an important 'ritual' to pass on our legacy 
                            to the new blood who will carry on our traditions and achievements.

                        <h3>Self-Initiated Learning: Digital Drawing</h3>
                        <p>
                            I always have a passion for art-related work, especially drawing. 
                            In fact, I started learning digital drawing back in 2020 when COVID-19
                            start, and to document my art journey, I actually have an Instagram
                            account (You can see it 
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drowninfashion/?hl=en">here</a>
                            ) dedicated to post my artwork! However due to increasing 
                            academic workload, I have stopped updating since January 2022. 
                            Reluctant to leave
                            my digital drawing skills to rust, I decided to devote part of my time in Home-Based 
                            Learning(HBL) day to enhance my digital drawing skills
                            and continue my experiment with different techniques to develop
                            my personal style! These are a few recent artworks that I'm proud of.

                        <p>
                            I have always been passionate about Kpop and dancing, so when I heard about 
                            the TJ Carnival is opening for performance sign-up, I decided to take the 
                            initiative and form a dance group with some of my friends who shared the same 
                            interest. We had to balance our academic work and our practice sessions, which 
                            was not easy. We also had to create our own choreography from scratch, which 
                            involved a lot of planning, teaching and coordination. Despite the challenges, 
                            we managed to meet up weekly for practice.
                            It turns out to be a successful performance which received a lot of positive
                            feedback from the audience. To us, that was the best 5 minute on stage we 
                            ever had this year. Gaining support from our cohort, our group went on to 
                            perform on Graduation Night as well with a whole new set of choreography!
                            This is indeed an unforgettable part of memory in my JC dance journey. <3

                        the IT field. Through this programme, I gained more exposure towards the career 
                        that I'm interested in and learned much about the expectations and 
                        requirements of skills in this industry. I also received helpful feedback and 
                        guidance from Mr. Khong, which helped me to have a clearer vision of my future

            <p id="ending">... and that's pretty much all about me! It has been a fruitful, memorable, and
                thrilling experience to study overseas. Sometimes, it can be quite daunting. Nonetheless,
                I look forward for what's coming next and always prepare to face whatever challenges that's
                waiting ahead. Bye for now!
